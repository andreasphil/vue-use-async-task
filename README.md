  <strong>Composable for state and results of asynchronous tasks in Vue</strong>
</p>

- ‚úÖ Manages `isLoading`, return values and errors automatically
- ü¶æ Works with any function that returns a promise
- üëå Fully typed and tested
- üôè Inspired by [SWR's](https://swr.vercel.app) API

## Installation

```
npm i github:andreasphil/vue-use-async-task#<tag>
```

## Usage

This package contains a Vue composable called `useAsyncTask` that returns a number of reactive variables commonly needed for handling state etc. when doing asynchronous work in components:

```ts
const { isLoading, data, error, hasError, run } = useAsyncTask(myAsyncTask);
```

Example with Vue:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useAsyncTask } from "vue-use-async-task";

async function myAsyncTask(param: string): Promise<string> {
  // Perform some async task, e.g. an API call
}

const { isLoading, data, error, run } = useAsyncTask(myAsyncTask);

// You can now use run() to run the function you provided to the composable.
// It takes the same parameters as the original function.
run("Hello world!");
</script>
```

The following reactive variables will be available:

- `run()`: Runs the function. Expects the same parameters as the original function.
- `isLoading`: Will be true until the function either resolves or rejects
- `data`: Returns the value with which the function resolved. This will _not_ be cleared automatically if you re-run or if running rejects. This allows you, for example, to refresh data without having your view suddenly appear empty while the refresh is running.
- `error`: Will contain the error if the function rejects. This is cleared automatically next time `run` succeeds.
- `hasError`: Will be true if `error` is truthy

### Accessing `run` result directly

In most cases, you'll want to work only with the reactive variables for managing state. However, in the rare case where you want to access the result of `run` imperatively, you can do so via its return value:

```ts
const [data, error] = await run();
if (error) {
  // Handle `error`
} else {
  // Do something with `data`
}
```

### Sharing between several tasks

If you have multiple asynchronous tasks on the same page, you can choose to share the `isLoading` and `error` states between them:

```ts
const { isLoading, error, run: runTaskA } = useAsyncTask(taskA);
const { run: runTaskB } = useAsyncTask(taskB, { isLoading, error });
```

Now `isLoading` will be `true` if either `taskA` or `taskB` are running. Both will store their error in `error`.
